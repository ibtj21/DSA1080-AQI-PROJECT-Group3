Air Quality Index in Baghdad, Iraq 
In March, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Baghdad fluctuated significantly. On several occasions, the PM2.5 levels dropped as low as 5 due to rain showers, which were accompanied by cool southerly winds. These conditions not only lowered the temperature but also reduced the particulate matter in the air. However, the PM2.5 levels also spiked to as high as 140 at times. This increase was caused by the same southerly winds becoming too strong, leading to dust storms that significantly raised the particulate matter in the air.
April experienced significant AQI variations. On April 9th, Baghdad Liberation Day, which marks the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime, there was a notable spike in AQI. Large rallies in Baghdad, coupled with a particularly dry month, high temperatures ranging from 35°C to 40°C, and only light rain showers, contributed to this increase. Occasionally, the PM2.5 levels dropped to as low as 7 due to rain showers and cool southerly winds. However, by the end of April, the beginning of the summer season brought a massive dust storm that caused the PM2.5 levels to rise dramatically to 540. This was accompanied by temperatures rising to 40°C and strong winds.
May marked the height of summer in Baghdad, characterized by multiple dust storms due to strong Shamal dry winds, no rainfall, low humidity, and temperatures ranging from 40°C to 45°C. These conditions led to several spikes in PM2.5 levels, with the highest reaching a value of 290.
The Air Quality Index in Baghdad is heavily influenced by weather conditions, resulting in significant day-to-day fluctuations. For instance, the AQI can drop to 5 due to rain showers and then spike to 140 due to dust storms. 
Over the months, the AQI has worsened gradually due to several factors, including high immigration into Baghdad, instability in neighbouring countries, and insecurity in some regions of Iraq. Baghdad, being one of the most stable economic zones in the region, has seen increased immigration, higher birth rates, rapid urbanization, and rapid industrialization, particularly due to the oil refineries built in the city. These factors contribute to the deteriorating air quality in Baghdad.

Air Quality Index in Nairobi, Kenya
March in Nairobi saw a relatively low Air Quality Index (AQI). The PM2.5 values ranged from a minimum of 2.7 to a maximum of 58, with an average PM2.5 value of 8.98, indicating very good air quality overall. In April, the situation changed significantly. The average PM2.5 value rose to 27.7, with values ranging from 0 to a peak of 170. May marked a drastic shift in air quality. The average PM2.5 value surged to 150, with the lowest recorded value at 41 and the highest reaching 210.
The AQI in Nairobi varies significantly from month to month due to a combination of factors, primarily weather and human activities.
•	Weather Impact: Starting in March, Nairobi experiences heavy rainfall, which, coupled with strong winds, initially improves air quality by dispersing pollutants. However, as the rainy season continues into April and May, the prolonged rains and persistent winds trap pollutants closer to the ground, leading to higher concentrations of particulate matter in a process called temperature inversion.
•	Human Activities: April, being an academic holiday month, sees a spike in tourism, which increases traffic emissions and industrial output. This, combined with Nairobi's ongoing waste management challenges, exacerbates the air quality issues. The situation worsens in May due to the compounded effects of continuous rainfall and increased pollutant concentration.
Nairobi's deteriorating air quality over these months is also influenced by its status as one of the most industrious and economically stable regions in Africa. This stability attracts high immigration rates for academic purposes, entrepreneurial ventures, and refuge. The influx of people contributes to increased emissions from vehicles, industries, and waste, further impacting the AQI negatively.
The AQI in Nairobi fluctuates greatly due to a combination of weather patterns and human activities. While the heavy rains initially help reduce pollution, they eventually lead to higher pollutant concentrations. Additionally, increased human activity during peak tourism and academic breaks, along with ongoing urbanization and industrialization, contribute to the worsening air quality over time.

Air Quality Index in Cairo, Egypt
Cairo is frequently affected by sandstorms and dust storms, which significantly raise the Air Quality Index (AQI). The city's air quality fluctuates throughout the year, influenced by various weather patterns and human activities.
In March, the AQI is relatively low compared to the rest of the year. This is primarily due to the cooler temperatures, averaging 23°C during the day and 12°C at night, along with occasional rain showers. These weather conditions help keep particulate matter levels down.
April sees a slight increase in the AQI. The temperatures rise to 26°C during the day and 15°C at night, with about half the amount of rainfall seen in March. The winds remain similar to March, with exceptionally strong gusts in the afternoons. These factors contribute to a higher concentration of particulate matter in the air.
May experiences a significant rise in the concentration of particulate matter due to the onset of the summer season. The average temperatures climb to 30°C during the day and 18°C at night. May is also characterized by being extremely dry, with occasional strong gusts of wind. These conditions make it easier for dust storms and sandstorms to develop, especially with the proximity to the Sahara Desert.
Over time, the PM2.5 levels in Cairo have worsened, primarily due to industrialization. Vehicle emissions are the largest contributors to particulate matter, followed by emissions from factories and power plants. Additionally, burning practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture and open-air burning of trash and plastic, which are common waste management methods in Cairo, contribute significantly to particulate matter levels.
